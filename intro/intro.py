'''what is programming language?
    -It hepls to communicate with computer
     -Programming language converts in binary language
     -programming language chai aagadi hamile bujxa ani execute vae sake paxi computer le bujxa binary language

    # Which language  does the computer understands
    -The computer understands binary language(0,1)
*Types of programing language-c++, javascript etc
# on the basis of execution

    1.compiled:it translate code from high level programming languageinto machine code
      before the programs runs or 
    2.Interpreted:It translate code written in a high level programming language 
    into machine code line by line as the code runs
*Python
  -It was developed by Guido van Rossum
  -It used interpreter language
  -It is a high level programming language
  -it is a open source 
  it is easy to learn and use , python is a advance language

    # Why  a python is a advance language?
    -various high level it sector haru ma chai python use hunxa like, AI,Data science, chat gpt




  # PIP
     -it is a package manager and if we give an order to it then what we need it search
    from the internet and make ready for us and install the python interpreter 
  #python syntax
      -syntax if the way of writing a programming language while making a script( hamile kasari 
      lekhnu parxa teslai define garnu nai syntax ho)
#Keywoards
    - prereserved words which have special meaning according to the programming 
    language we use for example: if ,else ,while, false ,true ,continue, and etc.(programming
    language ma pahila reserve vako words ho jun chai programming language anusar farak parxa)
# Identifier
  -It is a name use to identify a ccertain codes it may be class name, function name,variable name, module name
  a=5
  as a is a identifier
  acii value
  ctrl+ shift +`= terminal

.


# Variable
  -It is a container which hepls to store data in our program with temporary
  -we use variable because kahile kahi hami sanga data dherae nai thulo hunxa ani tyo data 
  lai chai feri lekhera copy garera print garnu garo hunxa so tyo problem lai chai solve garna
  help garxa tes variable lai call garda matra hunxa eg:a="kus"  print (a) hamile a lai jati recall gardah pni hunxa
  it is temporary store data 
  a=("hello world")
a= variable 

Hello world= data store of' a'
we cannot use space in variable

#camel case / lower camel case
  myVariablIsThis="Hello World"

#pascal case/ upper camel case
  MyVariableIsThis="Hello world"

#Snake Case
   My_Name_Is="Kus"
    these are use in function case

 #REPL= Read Evaluate Print Loop
 - it is how we interact with python or it is an computer environment where user input 
 are read and evaluate , and then the results are returned to the users. or print garxa ani evaluate hunxa
 we cannnot do code in repl or command prompt..... yesma multi line of code lekhna mildae na
#comment
   -certain code define which  doesnot run or compile
   it has two types of comment they are:
   1.single line comment - ctrl +/
   2.multi line comment - alt + shift +a
    -for  single comment line we use comment we use # 
    -for multile line we use''' '''

   # terminal
   -yesma c chai print garni kam garxa code 
   alt+ shift + down_arrow- copy same
